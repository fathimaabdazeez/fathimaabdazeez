# Hi there, I'm Fathima Abdul Azeez

I'm a data scientist with hands-on experience delivering **end-to-end data projects**. By end-to-end, I mean being involved right from understanding client requirements to implementing the complete pipeline — including **data ingestion, data engineering**, and **machine learning solutions**.

I’ve worked across different stages of the data lifecycle:
- Collecting and cleaning messy real-world data
- Building robust ETL pipelines
- Training and tuning ML/DL models
- Deploying and maintaining data-driven applications

Passionate about solving real-world problems through data, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to **combine AI with practical business needs**.

Currently exploring **LLMs, LangGraph, agentic AI, and generative applications**.
